# 📰 Fake News Detection - Machine Learning Project
Grant Thornton Training Program  
Machine Learning for Business Intelligence & Decision Systems  

---

## 📌 Project Objective

To build classification models that detect whether a news article is Fake or Real using supervised machine learning techniques.

---

## 📊 Dataset

- Target Variable: `Is_Fake`
- Binary Classification Problem:
  - 0 → Real News
  - 1 → Fake News

---

## ⚙️ Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Preparation

- Feature Scaling using StandardScaler

---

### 2️⃣ Models Implemented

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Naive Bayes

---

### 3️⃣ Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Precision
- Recall
- Model Comparison Table

---

## 📈 Model Comparison

The best performing model is selected based on highest test accuracy.

---
